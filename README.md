# Fisheries-monitoring-to-stop-illegal-practices
This is a Image Classification problem.

Machine learning has the ability to transform what we know about our oceans and how we manage them.In the Western and Central Pacific, where 60% of the worldâ€™s tuna is caught, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing practices are threatening marine ecosystems, global seafood supplies and local livelihoods.Our goal is to predict the likelihood of fish species in each picture.

Dataset used:can be found in dataset file.

Model used : ResNet34

learn.recorder.plot():
It helps to visualize the loss change for range of learning rate.We then choose a lr that is just before the loss starts increasing.

Error metric used :
error_rate(source:https://docs.fast.ai/metrics.html#error_rate): It calculates mean difference between predicted and target image.
